# data-science

This is the data repository for Lee J Hinkle for all things data science-related. As I learn, this will grow.  There may be some support files in here that will confuse the visitor, but I will strive to make it obvious as to what is worth looking at and what is not.  In the meantime, the visitor will have to act as a data analyst and decide what is and is not garbage.

:P
